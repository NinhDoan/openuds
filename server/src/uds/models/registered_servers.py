    UDS Registered Servers

    This table stores the information about registered servers for tunnel servers (on v3.6) or
    more recently, for other kind of servers that may be need to be registered (as app servers)

    kind field is a flag that indicates the kind of server that is registered. This is used to
    allow or deny access to the API for this server.
    Currently there are two kinds of servers:
    - Tunnel servers: This is the original use of this table, and is used to allow tunnel servers (1)
    - Other servers: This is used to register server that needs to access some API methods, but
        that are not tunnel servers (2)

    If server is Other, but not Tunnel, it will be allowed to access API, but will not be able to
    create tunnels.
